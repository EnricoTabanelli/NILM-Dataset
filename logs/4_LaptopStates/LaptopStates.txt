Laptop States CPU Stress - 29/11 - 15pm
Averaging over 20KHz

Using yes command from command line: yes /dev/null &
This command will repeat the word "yes" at such speed 
that consumes all available processor resources. Each 
instances of "yes" will max out a single thread on a 
single CPU core. This means that for a dual core mac 
with hyperthread processor, to put full load onto the
CPU we will need to have running at least 4 instances 
of "yes".
